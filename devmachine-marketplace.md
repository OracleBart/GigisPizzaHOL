## Accessing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) via VNC
To access a GUI via VNC, do the following:

1. Install a VNC viewer on your local computer
2. Use SSH to connect to the compute instance running the Oracle Cloud Developer Image, as described above (connect to the opc user)
3. Configure a VNC password by typing vncpasswd
4. When prompted, enter a new password and verify it
5. Optionally, enter a view only password
6. After the vncpasswd utility exits, start the VNC server by typing vncserver
8. This will start a VNC server with display number 1 for the opc user, and the VNC server will start automatically if your instance is rebooted
9. On your local computer, connect to your instance and create an ssh tunnel for port 5901 (for display number 1): 
```ssh
sh -L 5901:localhost:5901 â€“i id_rsa opc@<IP Address>
```
10. On your local computer, start a VNC viewer and establish a VNC connection to localhost:1
11. Enter the VNC password you set earlier
